## 2. Design & Implementation

### 2.1 Architecture Overview

TradeLog follows a modular CLI architecture, separating concerns into four main components:

* **Logic**: Handles prefix-based command parsing (e.g., `t/`, `d/`) and execution flow for commands.
* **Model**: Encapsulates the `Trade` entity and the `TradeList` collection, handling in-memory data representation and ROI calculations.
* **Storage**: Implements an **immediate-save mechanism**. After every successful state-changing command (add, edit, delete), the data is persisted to `tradelog.txt`.
* **UI**: Manages formatted console output and user interaction.

The diagram below shows the high-level flow of a user command through the system:

### 2.2 Design & Implementation

#### 2.2.1 UI Component

##### Architecture-Level Description

The `Ui` class is TradeLog's sole output layer. All console interaction — welcome banners, trade displays, error messages, and performance summaries — is centralised here. No other class calls `System.out` directly. This single-responsibility design means that if the output format ever needs to change (e.g., migrating from CLI to a GUI), only `Ui` needs to be modified.

The `Ui` class depends on the `TradeList` and `Trade` model classes for display purposes but has no dependency on `Storage`, `Parser`, or any `Command`. This keeps coupling low and makes the class independently testable.

##### Component-Level Description

`Ui` exposes the following categories of methods:

| Method Category    | Examples                                                          | Purpose                            |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Lifecycle messages | `showWelcome()`, `showGoodbye()`                                  | Displayed on startup and exit      |
| Trade display      | `printTradeList(TradeList)`, `printTrade(Trade)`                  | Format and print trade data        |
| Feedback messages  | `showTradeAdded()`, `showTradeDeleted()`, `showTradeUpdated(int)` | Confirm successful operations      |
| Summary display    | `showSummary(...)`, `showSummaryEmpty()`                          | Render performance metrics         |
| Error display      | `showError(String)`                                               | Wrap all errors in a divider block |

All output is framed with a fixed 80-character divider line (`DIVIDER`) produced by `"-".repeat(80)`. This gives the CLI a consistent visual structure and separates logical output blocks for readability.

Logging is embedded at the `INFO` level for successful operations and `WARNING` level for errors, using `java.util.logging.Logger`. This means that all UI interactions are traceable in the log output without polluting the console.

 │                │◄──────────────│───────────────│            │
```

##### Design Rationale

The alternative considered was to have each `Command` class print directly to `System.out`. This was rejected because:

1. It would scatter output logic across many classes, making visual consistency hard to enforce.
2. Unit testing would require capturing `System.out` in every command test rather than in one place.
3. Changing the output format (e.g., adding colour codes, or redirecting to a file) would require modifying every command.

Centralising in `Ui` means tests can use a `MockUi` subclass (as seen in `DeleteCommandTest` and `SummaryCommandTest`) to intercept output and assert on values without any `System.out` redirection overhead.

---

#### 2.2.2 ListCommand

##### Architecture-Level Description

`ListCommand` is one of the six core commands in v1.0. It is the simplest non-trivial command: it takes no arguments, performs no mutation of state, and delegates entirely to `Ui` for output. Its role is to bridge the user's request to view all trades with the display logic in `Ui`.

It extends `Command`, the abstract base class that defines the `execute(TradeList, Ui, Storage)` contract. Because `ListCommand` does not exit the application, it inherits the default `isExit()` return value of `false`.

##### Component-Level Description

```
«abstract»
Command
    │
    └── ListCommand
            │
            └── execute(tradeList, ui, storage)
                    │
                    └── ui.printTradeList(tradeList)
```

The `execute` method:

1. Asserts that `tradeList` and `ui` are non-null (defensive programming).
2. Logs the trade count at `INFO` level before delegation.
3. Calls `ui.printTradeList(tradeList)`, which handles both the empty-list case and the populated-list case.
4. Logs successful completion.

The `storage` parameter is accepted by the method signature (to satisfy the `Command` contract) but is deliberately unused, as listing trades requires no persistence interaction.

    │                │                 │ [else]             │
    │                │                 │  loop i=0..size-1  │
    │                │                 │──getTrade(i)───────►│
    │                │                 │◄── Trade ──────────│
    │                │                 │── println(trade)   │
    │                │◄────────────────│                    │
    │◄───────────────│                 │                    │
```

##### Design Rationale

An alternative considered was to have `ListCommand` access `TradeList` directly and format the output itself. This was rejected for the same centralisation reason described in the `Ui` section: it would duplicate formatting logic and make the output inconsistent with other commands. The current design keeps `ListCommand` as a thin orchestrator — it knows *when* to display trades, but not *how*.

---

#### 2.2.3 AddCommand

##### Architecture-Level Description

The `AddCommand` is a core state-changing operation responsible for introducing new trades into the TradeLog system. It acts as the primary bridge between the `Parser` component (which supplies the raw user input), the `Model` component (by instantiating new `Trade` objects and updating the in-memory `TradeList`), and the `Storage` component (triggering the immediate-save mechanism to persist the new data).

To adhere to the principle of Separation of Concerns, the execution of the `add` feature is explicitly split into two distinct phases: an initialization/validation phase, and an execution/mutation phase.

##### Component-Level Description

1. Construction & Validation Phase: When the user inputs an `add` command, the `Parser` creates a new `AddCommand(String arguments)`. The constructor immediately passes the raw string to the `ArgumentTokeniser` to map prefixes to their respective string values. It then utilizes `ParserUtil` to strictly validate the financial logic of the inputs (e.g., ensuring a `long` position does not have a stop-loss higher than the entry price, and checking that all prices are valid positive numbers). If any validation fails during this step, a `TradeLogException` is thrown before the `TradeList` or `Storage` is ever accessed.

2. Execution Phase: Once the `AddCommand` is successfully instantiated with a fully valid `Trade` object held in its internal state, the main loop calls `execute(tradeList, ui, storage)`. The command appends the new trade to the `TradeList`, triggers the `Ui` to display a confirmation message with the formatted trade details, and implicitly relies on the main loop's architecture to save the newly updated state to the text file.

```
##### Design Rationale

The alternative considered having the constructor simply store the raw user string, pushing all tokenizing and validation inside `execute()`. This was rejected because it violates the Single Responsibility Principle. It would bloat the `execute()` method with string manipulation, financial logic validation, memory updates, and UI updates all at once, making unit testing significantly more difficult.

---

#### 2.2.4 DeleteCommand

##### Architecture-Level Description

`DeleteCommand` handles the removal of a specific logged trade from the application's memory. It relies heavily on boundary checking to ensure that users do not attempt to delete trades that do not exist, successfully mapping the user's 1-based visual index (seen in the UI) to the internal 0-based `ArrayList` index of the model.

##### Component-Level Description

The constructor of `DeleteCommand` accepts a string representing the target index. It first performs superficial validation—checking for empty strings, non-numeric characters, and negative numbers—and throws a `TradeLogException` immediately if the input is malformed.

During `execute(tradeList, ui, storage)`, the command attempts to call `tradeList.deleteTrade(tradeIndex - 1)`. Because the `Parser` phase does not inherently know the current dynamic size of the `TradeList`, out-of-bounds errors cannot be caught during construction. Therefore, the `execute` method wraps the deletion call in a `try-catch` block targeting `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. If caught, it gracefully intercepts the crash and delegates an error message to `Ui.showError()`.

##### Sequence Diagram — `delete` execution with boundary handling

```

│                  │                  │ [if valid]       │
│                  │◄──deletedTrade───│                  │

│                  │◄────────────────────────────────────│
│                  │                  │ [if invalid]     │
│                  │◄──throws IndexOutOfBoundsException──│
│                  │──showError()───────────────────────►│
│                  │◄────────────────────────────────────│
│◄─────────────────│                  │                  │
```

##### Design Rationale

An alternative considered letting `DeleteCommand` throw the `IndexOutOfBoundsException` back up to the main `TradeLog` execution loop. This was rejected because the main loop would then need specific catch blocks for every possible internal data structure error across all commands. Keeping the error handling localized to the command ensures the main loop remains clean and strictly focused on high-level orchestration.

---

#### 2.2.5 SummaryCommand

##### Architecture-Level Description

`SummaryCommand` calculates and displays an aggregate mathematical performance report across the entire `TradeList`. Like `ListCommand`, it is a non-mutating operation; it reads the application's state to perform calculations but does not alter the data or interact with `Storage`.

##### Component-Level Description

When `execute()` is called, `SummaryCommand` first guards against an empty `TradeList`, triggering an early exit via `Ui.showSummaryEmpty()` if no trades exist.

If populated, it iterates through every trade in the list exactly once. During this single `O(n)` pass, it maintains running totals for total trades, winning trades, losing trades, total positive R-multiples, and total negative R-multiples. Break-even trades (where Risk/Reward equals 0) are safely skipped in the specific win/loss tallies but are correctly factored into the total trade count and Expected Value (EV) denominator.

After the loop completes, it calculates the win rate, average win, average loss, and EV, passing these final primitive floating-point values directly to `Ui.showSummary()` for formatting.

```

##### Design Rationale

An alternative considered having `TradeList` maintain running totals internally (e.g., updating a `totalWins` and `totalLosses` variable every time an `add`, `delete`, or `edit` command is executed). This was rejected because it heavily couples the core data model to a specific reporting feature. It would also make state-changing operations significantly more complex and prone to synchronization bugs (e.g., if a user edits a trade from a "loss" to a "win", the `TradeList` would have to reverse previous mathematical operations).

---

#### 2.2.6 Testing Strategy for `Ui` and `ListCommand`

Both `Ui` and `ListCommand` are tested using a `captureOutput` helper that temporarily redirects `System.out` to a `ByteArrayOutputStream`. This pattern avoids any dependency on mocking frameworks and works natively with JUnit 5.

The three `UiTest` cases cover:
- Empty list rendering (`printTradeList` with no trades).
- Welcome message format (`showWelcome`).
- Error message wrapping (`showError`).

The two `ListCommandTest` cases cover:
- That the command correctly delegates to `Ui` and produces the empty-list message.
- That `isExit()` returns `false`, confirming it does not terminate the application.

Both test classes confirm that **no state is mutated** by these components — they are pure output operations.

#### 2.2.7 [v2.0] Strategy Shortcut Expansion Feature

##### Overview

Power users who log tens of trades per session type strategy names frequently. To reduce friction, v2.0 introduces **strategy shortcut expansion**: a set of predefined abbreviations that are automatically expanded to their full strategy names before a trade is saved.

The supported shortcuts are:

| Shortcut | Expanded Strategy Name |
|----------|------------------------|
| `BB`     | Breakout               |
| `TBF`    | Trend Bar Failure      |
| `PB`     | Pullback               |
| `MTR`    | Major Trend Reversal   |
| `HOD`    | High of Day            |
| `LOD`    | Low of Day             |
| `MR`     | Mean Reversion         |
| `TR`     | Trading Range          |
| `DB`     | Double Bottom          |
| `DT`     | Double Top             |

##### Implementation

The expansion is implemented as a static lookup in `ParserUtil.parseStrategy(String)`.
This strategy parsing pipeline is used by `AddCommand`, `EditCommand`, and `FilterCommand`.

The feature uses an immutable `Map<String, String>` constant, `STRATEGY_SHORTCUTS`,
defined at the class level:

```java
private static final Map<String, String> STRATEGY_SHORTCUTS =
        createStrategyShortcuts();

public static String parseStrategy(String strategy) {
    String trimmedStrategy = strategy.trim();
    return STRATEGY_SHORTCUTS.getOrDefault(
            trimmedStrategy.toUpperCase(), trimmedStrategy);
}
```

If the input does not match any known shortcut, it is returned unchanged. This means custom strategy names (e.g., `Gap Fill`) continue to work without modification.

##### Sequence Diagram - Strategy shortcut expansion during `add`

![Strategy shortcut expansion sequence](diagrams/strategy-shortcut-add-sequence.png)

##### Why Implemented This Way

Expansion is done at parse time, not at display time. This means:

1. The expanded name is what gets stored in the file. If the user runs `list`, they see `Breakout`, not `BB`.
2. The `compare` command (see below) groups by the expanded name, so `BB` and `Breakout` entered by different team members are correctly unified.
3. The `Trade` object is always constructed with a clean, canonical strategy name.

**Alternatives considered:**

- **Expand at display time only**: Rejected because stored data would contain abbreviations, making the storage file harder to read and causing grouping bugs in the `compare` command.
- **Store the abbreviation and expand only in reports**: Rejected for the same reasons as above. Canonical data at the source is simpler and safer.
- **Use an enum instead of a lookup map**: Considered, but a lookup map keeps the parsing logic lightweight and easy to extend.

#### 2.2.8 [v2.0] Strategy Comparison Feature (`compare` command)

##### Overview

The `compare` command allows a trader to see performance metrics broken down by strategy. Instead of viewing one aggregate summary across all trades, the user can see exactly how each individual strategy performs - win rate, average win, average loss, and expected value (EV) - in a single command.

**Example output:**

```
compare

Strategy Comparison:

Breakout:
Trades: 15
Win Rate: 60%
Average Win: 2.02R
Average Loss: 0.95R
EV: +0.832R

Pullback:
Trades: 20
Win Rate: 50%
Average Win: 1.50R
Average Loss: 1.00R
EV: +0.250R
```

##### Architecture-Level Design

The `compare` command follows the same architecture as every other command in TradeLog. It fits into the existing structure without requiring any changes to `TradeLog`, `TradeList`, or `Storage`.

The new classes and modifications required are:

| Class            | Change                                                   |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `CompareCommand` | New class extending `Command`                            |
| `StrategyStats`  | New helper class for per-strategy aggregates             |
| `Parser`         | Add `case "compare"` to the switch                       |
| `Ui`             | Add `showStrategyComparison(Map<String, StrategyStats>)` |

A helper value object `StrategyStats` is introduced to group per-strategy metrics:

```java
class StrategyStats {
    int tradeCount;
    int winCount;
    int lossCount;
    double totalWinR;
    double totalLossR;
}
```

##### Component-Level Description

The `execute` method of `CompareCommand` performs the following steps:

1. **Guard**: If `tradeList` is empty, delegate to `ui.showSummaryEmpty()` and return.
2. **Grouping**: Iterate through all trades. For each trade, call `trade.getStrategy()` and use `strategyComparison.computeIfAbsent(...)` on a `LinkedHashMap<String, StrategyStats>` to look up or create the corresponding accumulator. A `LinkedHashMap` is used to preserve insertion order so strategies appear in the order they were first logged.
3. **Accumulation**: Call `trade.getRiskRewardRatio()` and pass the result to `strategyStats.addTrade(...)` so the per-strategy counts and totals are updated in one place.
4. **Display**: After the loop, pass the populated map to `ui.showStrategyComparison(...)`, which formats and prints each strategy block.

##### Class Diagram - CompareCommand and its dependencies

##### Design Rationale

**Why a `LinkedHashMap` and not sorting alphabetically?**
Traders tend to think of their strategies in the order they used them, not alphabetically. Preserving insertion order makes the output feel natural. A future `compare sort/alpha` variant could sort alphabetically if desired.

**Why not add grouping logic to `TradeList`?**
`TradeList` is a model class that should only manage the collection - add, delete, get, and size. Adding grouping logic there would violate single responsibility. `CompareCommand` is the correct place for this aggregation, consistent with how `SummaryCommand` handles its own calculations.

**Why not reuse `SummaryCommand`'s logic?**
`SummaryCommand` calculates one aggregate result. `CompareCommand` calculates `n` independent results (one per strategy). Though the per-strategy arithmetic is similar, merging them into a single class would make both harder to read, test, and extend independently.

**Alternatives considered:**

- **A `filterByStrategy` method on `TradeList`**: This was considered to avoid iterating through all trades in `CompareCommand`. However, it would require multiple passes (one per unique strategy), making it O(n x k) where `k` is the number of strategies. The single-pass accumulation approach is O(n) and simpler.
- **Storing `StrategyStats` inside `TradeList` as a cached field**: Rejected because it would couple the model to a specific reporting concept and require cache invalidation on every add/edit/delete.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Platform Independence**: Must run on any OS with Java 17 or higher installed.
2. **Performance**: Statistics calculation (EV, ROI) should take <100ms for up to 2,000 trades.
3. **Data Persistence**: Immediate auto-save to `tradelog.txt` after every valid state-changing command.
4. **Offline Capability**: All trade data must be stored locally without requiring cloud connectivity.

---

## 6. Glossary

* **Ticker**: Unique symbol representing a traded asset (e.g., AAPL).
* **R:R (Risk:Reward)**: The ratio of potential profit to potential loss.
* **EV (Expected Value)**: The average amount a trader can expect to win or lose per trade.
* **ROI (Return on Investment)**: Percentage return relative to capital.
* **R-multiple**: A trade's profit or loss expressed as a multiple of the initial risk (e.g., a 2R win means the trade made twice the amount risked).
* **Strategy shortcut**: A predefined abbreviation (e.g., `BB`) that the system automatically expands to a full strategy name (e.g., `Breakout`) at parse time.

## 7. Instructions for Manual Testing

### 7.1 Initial Launch

1. Ensure the `data/` folder is empty.
2. Run `java -jar TradeLog.jar`.
3. Verify that the application creates a fresh `tradelog.txt` file.

### 7.2 Testing CRUD (v1.0)

1. **Add**: `add t/TSLA d/2026-03-18 dir/long e/200 x/220 s/190 o/win strat/Trend`
2. **Edit**: `edit 1 x/230`
3. **Delete**: `delete 1`
4. **List**: `list` (Verify it reflects changes immediately in the console).

### 7.3 Testing Strategy Shortcuts (v2.0)

1. Run: `add t/AAPL d/2026-03-18 dir/long e/150 x/165 s/140 o/win strat/BB`
2. Run: `list`
3. Verify the stored strategy name is `Breakout`, not `BB`.
4. Run with an unrecognised shortcut: `add t/TSLA d/2026-03-18 dir/long e/200 x/220 s/190 o/win strat/CustomStrat`
5. Verify the strategy is stored as `CustomStrat` unchanged.

### 7.4 Testing Strategy Comparison (v2.0)

1. Add at least two trades with different strategy names (or shortcuts).
2. Run: `compare`
3. Verify that each strategy appears as a separate block with correct trade count, win rate, and EV figures.
4. Run `compare` on an empty trade list and verify the empty-list message is shown.
