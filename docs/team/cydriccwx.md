## Overview

TradeLog is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application designed for proprietary financial traders who rely heavily on mathematical data to refine their trading systems. It provides a fast, keyboard-centric way to systematically log trades, replacing slow and error-prone spreadsheet entry. The application automatically calculates critical trading metrics such as Risk:Reward (R) ratios, Win Rates, and Expected Value (EV), allowing traders to identify their mathematical edge with precision. TradeLog is built in Java and features an immediate-save, localized file architecture to ensure no data is lost during high-stress trading sessions.

| **Application Architecture**  | Established the foundational project structure by creating and organising all core packages (`tradelog.logic`, `tradelog.model`, `tradelog.storage`, `tradelog.ui`, `tradelog.exception`).                                                                                                                                       |
| **Core Domain Models**        | Designed and built the central `Trade` entity, encapsulating all trade data (ticker, entry, exit, stop loss, strategy). Implemented essential trading logic within the class, including automated Risk:Reward ratio calculations and storage string formatting.                                                                  |
| **Command Logic**             | Implemented core execution features including `AddCommand` for safely storing added trades, `SummaryCommand` for iterating through the logged trades to compute advanced statistics (Win Rate, Average Win/Loss, Expected Value, Total R), and `ExitCommand` for clean application termination.                                  |
| **Parser & Validation**       | Implemented the entire `Parser` component from scratch. Implemented `ArgumentTokeniser` to dynamically extract user prefixes. Implemented **`Parser`** for command routing and **`ParserUtil`** for reusable data parsing and validation helpers (price parsing, ticker formatting, direction validation, stop loss validation). |
| **Defensiveness**             | Added exception handling across `AddCommand` and `SummaryCommand`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Standards & QA**            | Followed the team's coding standards across all owned files, and wrote JUnit tests for `AddCommandTest`, `ParserTest`, `ArgumentTokeniserTest`, `SummaryCommandTest`, `ListCommandTest`, `DeleteCommandTest`, `CommandTest`, `TradeTest` and `TradeListTest`.                                                                      |

### Contributions to the User Guide (Extracts)
The following is an extract showcasing my contribution to the command documentation in the User Guide, demonstrating my focus on clear, user-centric instructions.

#### 5.1 Adding a Trade: `add`
Logs a new completed or open trade into your journal. All parameters are required. TradeLog will automatically calculate your Risk:Reward (R) multiple based on your entry, exit, and stop-loss prices.

**Format:** `add t/TICKER d/DATE dir/DIRECTION e/ENTRY x/EXIT s/STOP o/OUTCOME strat/STRATEGY`

**Example:**
`add t/AAPL d/2026-03-18 dir/long e/150 x/165 s/140 o/win strat/Breakout`

**Expected Output:**
```text
Trade successfully added.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trade Summary:
Ticker: AAPL
Date: 2026-03-18
Direction: Long
Entry: 150
Exit: 165
Stop: 140
Strategy: Breakout

Risk:Reward: +1.50R
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trade successfully added
```

#### 5.2 Listing all Trades: `list`
Displays a numbered list of all trades currently stored in your TradeLog. This is useful for reviewing your recent activity and finding the `INDEX` number of a trade you want to edit or delete.

**Format:** `list`

**Expected Output:**

```text
Here are your logged trades:
1. AAPL | 2026-03-18 | Long | E:150 | TP:165 | SL:140 | win | Breakout
1. TSLA | 2026-03-18 | Long | E:150 | TP:165 | SL:140 | win | Breakout
```

#### 5.3 Editing a Trade: `edit`
Updates specific details of a previously logged trade. You must provide the `INDEX` of the trade (which you can find using the `list` command) followed by only the prefixes you wish to change.

**Format**: `edit INDEX [PREFIX/VALUE]...`

**Example:**
You accidentally logged the TSLA exit price as 210, but it was actually 205. You also want to change the stop loss price.
edit 2 x/205 s/205

**Expected Output:**

```text
Trade 2 updated successfully.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trade Summary:
Ticker: TSLA
Date: 2026-03-19
Direction: Short
Entry: 200.0
Exit: 205.0
Stop: 205.0
Strategy: Trend

Risk:Reward: -1.00R
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### 5.4 Deleting a Trade: `delete`
Permanently removes a trade from your log using its `INDEX` number. Use this to clean up accidental duplicate entries or test data.

**Format**: `delete INDEX`

**Example:**
`delete 2`

**Expected Output:**

```text
Trade deleted successfully:
TSLA | 2026-03-19 | Short | Entry: 200.0 | Exit: 205.0 | -0.50R | BE
```

#### 5.5 Viewing Performance Metrics: `summary`
Analyzes your entire `TradeList` and calculates key mathematical metrics to help you understand the performance and edge of your trading system.

**Format**: `summary`

**Expected Output:**

```text
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall Performance:

Total Trades: 3
Win Rate: 100%
Average Win: 3.83R
Average Loss: 0.00R
Overall EV: +3.83R
Total R: +11.50R
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### 5.6 Exiting the Program: `exit`
Safely saves your data to the local text file and shuts down TradeLog.

**Format**: `exit`

### Contributions to the Developer Guide (Extracts)
The following is an extract from my section in the Developer Guide explaining the parsing architecture I designed.

#### 2.2.2 Parser Component

##### Architecture-Level Description

The parsing architecture is responsible for translating raw user input from the CLI into executable `Command` objects. To maintain separation of concerns and ensure financial data integrity, this logic is decoupled into three distinct utility classes: `Parser` (the command router), `ArgumentTokeniser` (the string extractor), and `ParserUtil` (the domain validator).

It takes the raw string, identifies the user's intent, extracts the variable data, enforces strict mathematical trading rules, and ultimately outputs a safe, validated command ready for execution.

##### Component-Level Description

```
«utility»
Parser
  |
  |-- parseCommand(userInput)
        |
        |-- routes to specific Command constructor
        \-- throws TradeLogException on unknown command

«utility»
ArgumentTokeniser
  |
  \-- tokenise(userInput, prefixes)
        |
        \-- returns HashMap<String, String> of prefix-value pairs

«utility»
ParserUtil
  |
  |-- parsePrice(priceString, fieldName)
  |-- parseTicker(ticker)
  |-- parseDirection(direction)
  |-- parseStrategy(strategy)
  |-- validatePrices(entryPrice, stopLossPrice)
  \-- validateStopLoss(direction, entryPrice, stopLossPrice)
```

The general parsing sequence for a complex command follows these steps:

1. `Parser` intercepts the raw string, splitting it into a `commandWord` and an `arguments` string.

2. A `switch` expression routes the `arguments` string to the corresponding `Command` constructor (e.g., `AddCommand`).

3. The command constructor delegates the `arguments` string to `ArgumentTokeniser`, which extracts a map of prefix-value pairs (e.g., `t/` -> `AAPL`).

4. The command extracts the mapped values and passes them to `ParserUtil` to enforce type safety (e.g., converting a string to a `double`) and trading logic (e.g., verifying stop-loss validity).

5. Once fully validated, the fully instantiated `Command` object is returned to the logic manager.


##### Design Rationale

**Centralisation of Validation:** An alternative considered was placing validation logic directly inside the respective `Command` classes (e.g., hardcoding the stop-loss verification inside `AddCommand`). This was rejected because it would lead to heavy code duplication across other commands that mutate trade states, such as `EditCommand`. Centralising this in `ParserUtil` keeps the commands as thin orchestrators and ensures mathematical trading rules are uniformly applied.

**Tokenisation Data Structure:** `ArgumentTokeniser` returns a `HashMap<String, String>` rather than a `List` of pairs. This was chosen to provide O(1) lookup time when commands need to retrieve their required parameters by prefix key, improving code readability and performance during high-speed data entry.
