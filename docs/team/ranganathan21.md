## Project: TradeLog

TradeLog is a desktop application for traders who prefer using a CLI. It allows users to log trades, review performance in `R` multiples, compare strategy results, and store their data in password-protected local profiles.

### Features implemented

1. **List/display workflow and shared UI**: implemented `ListCommand`, the `Command` abstraction, key parts of the `TradeLog` run loop, and the shared `Ui` used for trade display, summaries, undo feedback, and errors. This established the product's common CLI output style, centralized formatting logic, and later included bug-fix work around output formatting, startup handling, and run-loop reliability.

2. **Strategy shortcut support**: implemented canonical parsing and validation for shortcut inputs such as `BB`, `PB`, and `MTR`, and integrated them into `add`, `edit`, `filter`, and related tests. This improved logging speed while keeping stored strategy names normalized for filtering, comparison, and future maintenance. Relevant PR: [#44](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/44).
3. **Strategy comparison analytics**: implemented `compare` using `CompareCommand` and `StrategyStats` to show per-strategy trade count, win rate, average win, average loss, and EV. The implementation uses single-pass aggregation and canonicalized strategy names so variants do not split into separate groups, and it is supported by targeted tests and documentation. Relevant PR: [#46](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/46).

### Documentation

- **User Guide**: reworked the UG into an AB3-style structure, updated command documentation, and kept the sections for strategy shortcuts, `filter`, `compare`, encryption, and startup/save behavior aligned with the product.
- **Developer Guide**: documented the UI component, `ListCommand`, the strategy shortcut workflow, the `compare` feature, and the manual testing steps for the implemented features.
- **Project Portfolio Page**: updated my PPP to reflect the final implemented scope and linked PR history.
- These updates were aimed at keeping the docs aligned with the actual product instead of planned or outdated behavior, which reduced mismatch bugs during peer testing.
- Final bug-fix documentation updates covered startup input handling and session-save behavior so the docs stayed aligned with the last runtime fixes.

### Diagrams

Added or updated: `ui-print-trade-list-sequence`, `list-command-sequence`, `list-command-logic-diagram`, `strategy-shortcut-add-sequence`, `compare-sequence`, `compare-class-diagram`, `compare-object-diagram`.
